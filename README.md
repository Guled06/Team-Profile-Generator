  ## Description:

    This project was designed using Node.js, inquirer, and fs. The user of this project will be able to put together his/her team of employee in a profession and concise manner. 
  
  ## Installation:

    In order for this application to be used, the user must install Node.js in his/her CLI (Command Line Program). Once Node.js is installed, the user then must install inquirer in his/her Node.js by using the 'npm i' installation. This will facilitate the user to run inquirer in his/her application.

  ## Usage:

    I designed this application for the user to generate his/her team profile. The user can add valuable information for every team member. It prompts the user by asking series of questions. The user can add mutliple team members in the profile. The application provides the roles of "manager", "engineer" and "intern" and the user can select any of these roles to give it to the team member that the user wants to add. Once the user adds a team member, then the user will be be asked if he or she wants to add another team member. Depending on what role the user selects, there will be different types of questions that the user will have to answer for each role selected for the team member. Once all the team members are added, the prompts will end and the team profile will be generated, and readibly available to be viewed by the user.
